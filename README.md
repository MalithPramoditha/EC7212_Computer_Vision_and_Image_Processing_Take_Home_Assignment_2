# EC7212 Computer Vision and Image Processing Take Home Assignment 2

This repository contains my solutions for the EC7212 Computer Vision and Image Processing Take Home Assignment 2.

## Tasks

**Task 1:**  
Add Gaussian noise to a real image and use Otsu’s algorithm to automatically separate objects from the background.

**Task 2:**  
Segment objects in an image using the region growing technique, starting from seed points inside the objects.

## How to Use

- All code is written in Python and can be run in Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment.
- The sample images are loaded directly from the internet in the code.
- Simply run each code cell to see the results for both tasks.

## What You Will Learn

- How to add noise to images
- How to use Otsu’s thresholding for automatic image segmentation
- How to implement and use the region growing algorithm for segmenting objects

## Results

The results include:
- Original images
- Noisy images
- Images after Otsu’s thresholding
- Images segmented using region growing

This project is useful for anyone who wants to learn basic image processing and segmentation techniques in a simple and practical way.
